              <p>He is the quintessential family man. He went against his parents' wishes to pursue a career in fine
                arts – he’s
                strong-willed. Unfortunately, he hasn’t gotten his big break yet and try as he may, this gets to him
                sometimes. Nnamdi
                is proud, as seen in his relationship with his parents. The most important thing to him is his immediate
                family. When
                his son is diagnosed with the sickle cell disease, Nnamdi struggles to be the same supportive husband
                he’s always been.
                He juggles his pride, his lack of income and his seething anger at his wife’s career success.
                The prominent Okey Uzoeshi plays Nnamdi Ezeji.</p>

              <p>Yemi is smart, ambitious and down-to-earth. Though she makes money more steadily than her husband and
                therefore foots
                the bills needed to run the house effectively, she never lords it over him. She’s a bit hard on Ebere –
                it’s her brand
                of love. She dots on Ekene and would do anything to make sure he’s treated right. As a result of
                Nnamdi’s lack of steady
                income, Yemi has to work extra hard at the office to ensure the family lacks nothing. As such, she is
                nearly always away
                and misses memorable moments in the family's life. This chips at her and sometimes makes her feel
                distant from her
                family, especially her teenage daughter Ebere.
                Yemi Ezeji is the debut acting role for Shushu Abubakar</p>

              <p>All-round sweet boy. He is big on research. He is an excellent orator. Chinedu is the type of child
                every mother wishes
                they had. However, he cracks when he thinks he’s the reason for his parents’ near-constant squabbles.
                Chinedu has the
                charm that makes you know that surely his future is bright. He has a beautiful relationship with his
                sister such that
                when she denies him of the one thing he wants the most, he holds no grudge.
                The fast-rising child actor Nifemi Lawal is Ekene Ezeji.

              <p>She’s the glam girl of the class. Trendy and fab, she is the type of girl you want to hang out with.
                She’s a great
                pianist, and she flaunts it. Though Ebere is in the teenage years where she feels she knows more than
                her parents, she
                still craves their love and affirmation. And when she doesn’t get it, she switches from the sweet girl
                to a mean girl.
                Despite all her fluff and frills, Ebere loves her brother deeply, and this is never in doubt. She would
                let go of
                anything just for his sake. However, when the time came to give her ultimate sacrifice, Ebere is
                reluctant simply
                because she feels like a prop child, the one that coasts through life without the attention and
                affection of her
                parents.
                Ebere Ezeji is played by Angel Onyi Unigwe, a fast-rising child actor.
